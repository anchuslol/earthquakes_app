# Earthquake Analysis Dashboard

This project is a **Streamlit-based dashboard** designed to analyze earthquake data using various visualizations and clustering techniques. The data is sourced from the **USGS Earthquake Catalog** and includes information on earthquake magnitude, depth, and location.

## Features

- **Interactive Filters**: Filter earthquake data by date range, magnitude, depth, event type, and region.
- **Data Visualizations**:
  - Magnitude and depth distributions.
  - Geographic distribution of earthquakes using scatter maps and heatmaps.
  - Temporal patterns, including daily, weekly, and hourly trends.
- **Clustering Analysis**:
  - Identify clusters of earthquakes using the DBSCAN algorithm.
  - Visualize clusters on a map and analyze their characteristics.
- **Advanced Analysis**:
  - Correlation matrix for numerical variables.
  - Magnitude analysis by region.
  - Comparative analysis of numerical variables.
- **Downloadable Data**: Export filtered earthquake data as a CSV file.

## Installation
